# repository.coconut

This is a skin for my children to use to watch the old classics we've ripped as easily as watching shows on Prime/Netflix.

The goals to strip this addon down to just listing TV shows in a nice way with simple text descriptions and thumbnails. Ratings, links to other shows, etc. will slowly get ripped out.

To install (not tested):
- add the following address - https://cocorepo.github.io/repository.coconut/repository.coconut/ with kodi file manager
- go to skins and select

This is based on Skin TITAN BINGIE
